# Prerequisite Steps For The Samples

## Create a Project in the Google Cloud Platform Console

If you haven't already created a project, create one now. Projects enable you to
manage all Google Cloud Platform resources for your app, including deployment,
access control, billing, and services.

1. Open the [Cloud Platform Console][cloud-console].
1. In the drop-down menu at the top, select **Create a project**.
1. Give your project a name.
1. Make a note of the project ID, which might be different from the project
   name. The project ID is used in commands and in configurations.

## Install the Snapshot Debugger CLI and enable Firebase

Follow the instructions beginning at [Before you
begin](../README.md#before-you-begin) through to and including [Enable
Firebase for your Google Cloud
Project](../README.md#enable-firebase-for-your-google-cloud-project) to
get the Snapshot Debugger CLI installed and your project configured to use
Firebase.
