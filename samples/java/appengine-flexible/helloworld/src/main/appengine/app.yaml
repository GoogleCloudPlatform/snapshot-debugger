# 'custom` indicates a custom runtime will be used and a Dockerfile will be
# provided to create it.
runtime: custom
env: flex

# To note, all available environment variables for the Java 8 / Jetty 9 image
# can be found at the following two locations:
#  - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/dev-jetty9#variables
#  - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/dev-java-only#variables
env_variables:
  # Prevents the runtime from loading the current Cloud Debugger agent which is
  # present in the base runtime and enabled by default. Loading this agent
  # would confilict with the Snapshot Debugger agent. Eventually once the Cloud
  # Debugger has been turned down the base image will no longer contain the
  # agent and this won't be necessary.
  DBG_ENABLE: false

  # The contents of JAVA_USER_OPTS are added to the java command line. To note,
  # in this case the Java agent is able to find the class files (enabling it to
  # set breakpoints) without any extra configuration.  This is because the
  # jetty.base property gets set and the root.war file is extracted to
  # 'jetty.base'/webapps/root. There are times however you may need to also
  # configure cdbg_extra_class_path if the agent cannot find the class files,
  # see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-debug-java#extra-classpath
  # for more information.
