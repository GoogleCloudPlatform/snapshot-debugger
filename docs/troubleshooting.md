# Snapshot Debugger Troubleshooting

If you run into problems with Snapshot Debugger, file an
[issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/snapshot-debugger/issues).

## Your project doesnâ€™t show up when enabling Firebase

### Symptom

Your project id is not auto populated and is not present in the project dropdown
when you try to [Enable Firebase for your GCP Project][enable-firebase]

### Resolution

Check if the Firebase Management API is already enabled, as if it is, that
interferes with the process. Try using the following link to disable the
Firebase Management API, then go back and follow the steps in the [Enable
Firebase for your GCP Project][enable-firebase]

```
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/firebase.googleapis.com?project=PROJECT_ID
```

Where PROJECT_ID is your project ID.

## Your database in not displayed in the Firebase Console

### Symptom

A blank screen is shown when attempting to view database contents in Firebase
Console's Realtime Database section. The project is using the Blaze pricing
plan.

### Resolution

Rerun the init command to find the database's url. Use that url to view the
database's contents. See [Blaze plan RTDB setup][blaze-plan-setup] for
details, as noted there, it is safe to run the `init` command multiple times to
view your database's information.

The database's url should resemble `https://DATABASE_NAME.firebaseio.com`,
which should redirect to
`https://console.firebase.google.com/project/PROJECT_ID/database/DATABASE_NAME/data`
for the Firebase Console view.

## Your Debuggee Is Not Found

### Symptom

When you run the `snapshot-dbg-cli list_debuggees` command, a debuggee you
expect to be present is not shown.

### Resolution

There are a variety of potential causes for this, run through the following:

#### Wake your application up

For environments such as App Engine Standard, your application may not actually
be running. This can be the case if one of the following holds:

* You have just deployed your application and it has not yet received a request
* Enough time has passed since it last serviced a request, as a result the
  instance count may have been scaled to 0

Simply hitting your application's endpoint will cause your application to run,
and should cause the debuggee to be listed by `snapshot-dbg-cli list_debuggees`.

#### Ensure the required access scopes are in place

Ensure the required access scopes are configured for your environment so that
the Snapshot Debugger Agent is able to communicate with the Firebase RTDB
backend. See [Required Access Scopes][access-scopes] for more information.

#### Ensure the service account has the required permissions

Ensure the service account running your service has the required permissions.
See [Required Permissions][required-permissions] for more information. If you
set the permission, wait a few minutes before checking to see if the debuggee
now appears.
